# CultistCrusade
Game for Ludum Dare 43 with the theme _Sacrifices must be made_

This game was created in 3 days by 4 people with Unity 2018.

It features a procedurally generated dungeon, several ennemies, powerups and a swarm control system.

## Concept

CultistCrusade put you at the head of the local dark gods cult. A dungeon appeared near town and since the Paladins weren't home you are the one tasked with the clearing.


Embark on your mighty crusade against these puny monsters.
Explore the dungeon, sacrifices ennemies and cultists alike to appease the hunger of your god.

Then use the dark powers blessed on you to reinforce your minions!
